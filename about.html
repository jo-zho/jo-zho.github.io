            My name is Joanna Zhou, and I'm a junior at Texas A&M University in College Station. I am currently looking for an internship in software development for Summer 2021. I went to high school at the Kinder High School for Performing and Visual Arts with a concentration in creating writing.

            I loved growing up and living in Houston because of the diverse food and numerous things to do around town. The downside, you might say, of living in Houston is the weather, the continuously bipolar spectrum between storm and desert. I’ve grown to love that too.
            <br><br>
            It was in Houston that I first found my roots and my interests. Visiting the Museum District (mainly for the Museum of Natural Science), I discovered my love for computers and technology when an exhibition on computers and the history behind them was on display. I went home and researched for the entire day! Realizing that this might be what I want to do as a career, I applied to the Computer Science program at Texas A&M.
            <br><br>
            Looking forward, I hope to graduate with a BS in Computer Science and pursue a job in web development with a focus on UI/UX. I’ve watched many YouTube videos and interviews with front-end experts and have gotten a basic understanding for the work they do. Coupling that with my creative side seems like an ideal way to provide people with reliable and beautiful access to information across the internet, and it is something I am very passionate about. 
            <br><br>
            As for hobbies, I enjoy playing video games, reading books, and walking around exploring the city. Some of the games I currently play are Valorant, Genshin Impact, Left for Dead 2, the Sims 4, and Minecraft--although the main game is Valorant. I also enjoy listening to music and attending concerts, though less so now due to the current situation with COVID-19. Some genres of music I listen to are electronic dance music and alternative rock with a mix of dream pop.
